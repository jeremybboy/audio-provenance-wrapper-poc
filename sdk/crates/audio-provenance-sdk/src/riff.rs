/// Returns a copy of `wav` carrying `manifest` in its `aprv` chunk.

/// IMPORTANT: the file bytes change, so the manifest's own `content_sha256` can never recompute
/// over the result. That is not a defect to be hidden: the manifest's `decoded_audio_sha256` still
/// recomputes exactly, Trace reports the binding as `hard_exact_decoded_audio_only`, and it
/// attaches a `container_bytes_changed` finding saying the container was rewritten and no sample
/// moved. A caller that needs `content_sha256` to be the binding must use a sidecar instead.
