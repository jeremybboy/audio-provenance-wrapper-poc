## Project
`audio-provenance-wrapper-poc` is a macOS + Ableton Live proof of concept for opt-in audio provenance capture.

## Core Principle
Never claim full Ableton provenance. Only report what was routed, observed, hashed, declared, verified, bypassed, or missed.

## Target v0
A producer can:
1. Open Ableton Live.
2. Route one stem through a pass-through capture plugin.
3. Export a WAV or AIFF file.
4. See a JSON manifest linking observed stem data to the exported file hash.

## Tech Stack
- JUCE for plugin development.
- VST3 first; AU later.
- Local UDP for plugin-to-daemon events.
- macOS daemon/process for event collection and export watching.
- JSON fight-card manifest first.
- C2PA sidecar/signing later.

## Milestones
- v0.1: pass-through plugin.
- v0.2: local event logging.
- v0.3: UDP event stream to daemon.
- v0.4: daemon stores session state.
- v0.5: daemon detects final export and hashes the file.
- v1.0: JSON manifest generated end-to-end.

## Proof Levels
Every manifest field must include one of:
- `directly_observed`
- `inferred`
- `user_declared`
- `externally_verified`
- `unknown_unobserved`

## Constraints
- Do not build universal DAW capture for v0.
- Do not assume hidden plugin internals are observable.
- Do not claim sample license, device identity, preset identity, or upstream provenance unless externally verified.
- Prefer a working one-stem demo over a broad incomplete system.

## Instructions for AI Agents
Before editing, read:
1. `README.md`
2. `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
3. `docs/ROADMAP.md`
4. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
5. `docs/MANIFEST_SCHEMA.md`

When making changes:
- Keep edits small and milestone-scoped.
- Update documentation when architecture or schema changes.
- Do not overclaim provenance guarantees.
- Prefer explicit TODOs over pretending a hard problem is solved.
