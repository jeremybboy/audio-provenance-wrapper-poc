"""Manifest assembly for a completed export: fight-card manifest, forgery
analysis, coverage derivation, signing, and companion artifact rendering.

Extracted from ``daemon.Daemon._generate_manifest`` / ``_derive_coverage`` /
``_derive_forgery_analysis``; these are thin wrappers around the ``Daemon``
instance rather than pure functions because the source method reads and
writes a large slice of daemon session state (session lock, event buffers,
last-artifact-path bookkeeping) that is not worth re-threading through an
explicit parameter list for a pure refactor.
